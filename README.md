This is a project I made for my Introduction to Programming Practicum Course at FMI, Sofia Univeristy. This interactive Geometry Tool can help you solve the following Analytic geometry problems:

1. Determine the equation of a line using its coefficents or two points and their coordinates
2. Check if a point lies on a certain line
3. Determine the equation of the line that passes through a point and is parallel to another line
4. Determine the equation of the line that is perpendicular to another line and passes through a point that lies on the given line
5. Find the intersection point of two lines, if it exists
6. Determine the equations of all altitudes, medians, symetrals are and perimeter of a triangle defined by the coordinates of its vertices
7. Find the tangent of a parabolyc equation (ax^2+bx+c=y) through a point
8. Determine the intersection point of a line and a parabola
9. Determime if four lines form a quadrilateral and its type. If they don't, show an appropriate message

You can also name your lines and points with Latin alphabet letters, digits and '_'. Max 10 symbols for every name!
